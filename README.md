# Quizzler

This is a Flutter app (written in Dart) which is essentially a quiz app. It asks you a series of questions and indicates whether you got each quiz answer right or not.

The app was the result of a class taken from the good folks at London App Brewery

Lessons learned from this app included:

- Modularising code into separate classes
- Learning about Dart classes and objects
- Using class constructors
- Extracting Widgets to refactor code
- private and public modifiers in Dart
- How to use Dart lists
- The difference between var, const and final
